# hello-world
Getting started with GitHub with a brand spanking new repository.

What is this project about? It's a testing ground, a coming of age, a virtual walkabout through a mix of civilized and uncharted lands. The purpose of this project is to help me get up to speed with modern code development techniques that I have previously only read about, but now I will be putting into practice.
